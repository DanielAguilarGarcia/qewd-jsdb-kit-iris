# About this Repository

This repository provides a kit for installing, configuring and running
QEWD and the QEWD-JSdb Explorer Applications on the IRIS Community Edition
Docker Container.

Once installed, you can explore the Multi-Model Database capabilities of
QEWD-JSdb.  In particular, you'll be able to see and manipulate:

- persistent JavaScript Objects
- document database
- Redis-like Lists
- Redis-like Key/Object storage
- persistent XML Dom / Native XML Database with built-in XPath Query Support

all implemented in Node.js/JavaScript and abstracted onto IRIS Global storage.

If you want to find out more about the concepts and thinking behind QEWD-JSdb,
[watch this video of a presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TlAKTw167s&list=PLam_80-FY3vSPW9apMaczTN_4dtke9GYM)
 I gave to the London Node.js User Group
in January 2020.


# Installation and Configuration

It only takes minutes and a few simple, largely-automated
steps to get QEWD and the QEWD-JSdb Exploration kit installed and working
on the IRIS Community Editition Docker Container.

Read and follow the [Installation and Configuration Instructions here](./INSTALL.md).


# An Initial Guide to QEWD-JSdb using the Node.js REPL

Familiarise yourself with the concepts behind QEWD-JSdb by
[taking the initial tutorial](./REPL.md) where you can
interact directly with the QEWD-JSdb abstraction of your IRIS
Global Storage withing the Node.js REPL.


# Model-Specific Exploration

Once you're familiar with the basics of QEWD-JSdb, you can begin exploring how
it has been used to create a number of other database models, including:

- Redis-like Lists

  - [Tutorial](./LISTS.md)
  - [Explorer Application](./LISTS-EXPLORER.md)


- Redis-like Key/Object Storage
  - [Tutorial](./KVS.md)
  - [Explorer Application](./KVS-EXPLORER.md)

- Persistent XML DOM / Native XML Database
  - [Tutorial](./DOM.md)
  - [Explorer Application](./DOM-EXPLORER.md)
